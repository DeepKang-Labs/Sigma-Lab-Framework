# Patch 3 – Empirical Suite Integration

**Commit global résumé**

merge(patch3): integrate empirical analysis suite (case comparison, multi-evaluator, sensitivity)

## Description
Integrates the full empirical analysis layer for Sigma-Lab v5.1.

Included tools:
- tools/case_compare.py → Case similarity & calibration engine  
- tools/multi_evaluator.py → Consensus & divergence analyzer  
- tools/sensitivity.py → Stability & robustness tester  

New capabilities:
- Empirical calibration on historical datasets (10 validated cases)
- Consensus quantification via Ethical Divergence Index (IDE)
- Sensitivity sweeps for detecting fragile decisions
- Unified CLI usage and consistent YAML schema

## Validation
✅ Passed GitHub Smoke Test #17  
✅ All imports and dependencies resolved  
✅ YAML real-case dataset successfully validated  

## Why this matters
This patch transforms Sigma-Lab from a procedural prototype
into an empirical ethical research environment — aligning with
Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek’s joint recommendations.
