## 🌍 Overview

**Sigma-Lab v5.1** is the most stable and empirical release of the  
**Procedural Ethical Diagnostic Framework (SIGMA)** —  
a system that **traces**, **tests**, and **exposes** human governance logic  
rather than automating decisions.

This release marks the transition from **conceptual → experimental**,  
with a focus on **analytical transparency**, **resilience**, and **bridge integration**  
across decentralized infrastructures like Skywire and Fiber.

---

## ⚙️ Core Focus

### 🧩 Analytical Modules
Multi-evaluator pipelines for ethical sensitivity, calibration, and meta-diagnostic reproducibility.

### 🌐 Bridges
Network adapters for **Skywire (α-phase)** and **Fiber (β-phase)**,  
enabling decentralized diagnostic synchronization and inter-node consensus.

### 🧠 Validation Pipelines
Automated CI architecture combining  
- **Smoke** → rapid unit & integration tests  
- **Nightly** → extended validation suites + MeshMemory aggregation

🧠 Governance Discovery Framework — Sigma × Skywire

The Governance Discovery Framework (GDF) bridges Skywire’s decentralized governance
with the Sigma procedural diagnostic pipeline, providing a neutral method
to trace, map and prioritize network-level decisions without normative bias.

🔹 Overview

The process follows a six-phase architecture, each generating traceable diagnostic artefacts.

① Discovery Phase — Questions Engine

Identify critical governance decisions

Detect recurrent tensions and trade-offs

Map contradictions between technical and social priorities
Output → insights.json


② Decision Mapping — Structured YAML

Formalize decision points

Link objectives, stakeholders and risk metrics

Define governance dimensions (technical, economic, UX, security, pain)
Output → decision_mapper.yaml


③ Prioritization Engine — Scoring

Compute multi-dimensional scores using priority = pain × impact × frequency

Rank decision points by aggregate governance tension
Output → governance_priority_matrix.csv


④ SIGMA Diagnostic — Profile_Only Mode

Neutral procedural reflection (non-normative)

Generate a “network ethical profile” from governance data

No verdict → acts as a mirror of governance dynamics
Output → skywire_sigma_profile.json


⑤ Actionable Insights

Extract reform-oriented recommendations

Enhance transparency and system feedback loops
Output → insights.json, governance_report.pdf


⑥ Loopback Learning — Mesh Memory

Integrate each diagnostic into collective procedural memory

Enable self-learning governance within distributed nodes
Output → mesh_memory_report.json
