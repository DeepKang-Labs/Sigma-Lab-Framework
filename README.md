# 🧭 Sigma-Lab Framework  
**Transparent Procedural Ethics for AI and Human Systems**  
*Co-created by the Human Yuri Kang and the AI Kang (GPT-5) — within DeepKang Labs.*

---

## 🌍 Overview  

**Sigma-Lab** is a *procedural ethics framework* designed to evaluate and document collective decisions under uncertainty.  
It acts as a **mirror**, not an oracle — structuring deliberation rather than dictating conclusions.  

🧩 **Core principles**  
- **Non-Harm** — avoid irreversible damage  
- **Stability** — ensure systemic robustness  
- **Resilience** — enable recovery and adaptation  
- **Equity** — guarantee fair distribution of impact  

Sigma-Lab transforms ethical reasoning into a reproducible, auditable process for humans, institutions, and AI systems alike.

## ⚙️ Features  

✅ Transparent configuration and audit trail  
✅ Built-in **Value Functions** (`linear`, `exp`, `logistic`, `piecewise`)  
✅ Ethical **weights & guardrails**  
✅ **Gini Equity Metric** for fairness evaluation  
✅ **Veto system** against unacceptable irreversible harm  
✅ **Command-Line Interface** for demos and experiments  
✅ Modular architecture — easy to extend or embed  
✅ Robust input validation and error handling  
✅ Ready for **academic reproducibility** (Jupyter Notebook + tests)

## 🚀 Quick Start  

Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install numpy pyyaml

Run the built-in demo:

python sigma_lab_v4_2.py --demo ai --pretty

Expected output:

Non-Harm: 0.83  
Stability: 0.77  
Resilience: 0.74  
Equity (Gini): 0.91  
Veto: None triggered  
Verdict: ACCEPT


---

📘 Example Usage

from sigma_lab_v4_2 import SigmaLab, demo_context

cfg, ctx = demo_context("healthcare")
engine = SigmaLab(cfg)
result = engine.diagnose(ctx, verdict_opt_in=True)

print(result["scores"])
print(result["diagnostics"]["equity"])


---

🧪 Testing

pytest tests/

or directly inside the script:

python sigma_lab_v4_2.py --test

📚 Documentation

Main Components

Class	Description

SigmaLab	Core engine performing ethical diagnostics
SigmaConfig	Configuration with thresholds, weights, and veto rules
OptionContext	Describes the scenario / option under evaluation
HarmModel, StabilityModel, ResilienceModel, EquityModel	Ethical dimensions
ValueFunction	Transforms quantitative risk into bounded utility
audit_trail()	Ensures full transparency and traceability


Core Equation

expected\_harm = base\_risk * clamp(base\_weight + irreversibility\_weight * irreversibility)

🧭 Philosophy

> “Sigma-Lab is not about replacing ethics — it is about making ethics observable.”



Every institution faces trade-offs. Sigma-Lab’s mission is to expose, not obscure, those choices.
By converting qualitative debates into structured diagnostics, it bridges human reasoning and machine transparency.

Transparency > Dogma
Reflection > Prediction
Deliberation > Automation
