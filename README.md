## 🌍 Overview  

**Sigma-Lab v6.0** marks the transition from *empirical experimentation* to *operational autonomy*.  
It remains a procedural framework designed to **trace**, **test**, and **expose** ethical logic in distributed AI systems, emphasizing transparency over automation.  

It now operates as a **multi-agent diagnostic core**, bridging autonomous AI nodes through **Skywire**, **Fiber**, and **XBTS** infrastructures.  
The framework harmonizes machine introspection, human judgment, and decentralized consensus.

> *“SIGMA does not replace judgment — it reveals where judgment hides.”*

## 🔩 Core Focus  

### 🧮 Analytical Modules  
- Multi-evaluator pipelines for *ethical sensitivity*, calibration, and reproducibility.  
- Integrated bridge logic (Skywire Vitals → Sigma Transform).  
- Continuous telemetry validation and structured JSON/Markdown synthesis.  

### 🌐 Bridges  
Adapters for **Skywire (α-phase)** and **Fiber (β-phase)** enabling decentralized synchronization and inter-node validation.  

### 🧬 Validation Pipelines  
Automated CI architecture combining:  
- `Smoke` → rapid unit + integration tests  
- `Sigma Integration` → extended diagnostic bridges + fallback autonomy

## 🤖 Agents Overview  

### 1️⃣ Skywire VitalSigns (ingestion)  
Collects network signals, normalizes data, and produces structured telemetry snapshots.  

### 2️⃣ Skywire Report (analysis)  
Aggregates daily data → generates Markdown reports, CSV timelines, and auto-badges.  

### 3️⃣ Sigma Bridge (Transform → Integration)  
Converts Vitals into Sigma-compliant diagnostic states, maintaining synchronization with Skywire and fallback JSON resilience.

🧘 Philosophy

> “Each number is a pulse.
Each report is a memory.
The network breathes — Sigma listens.”



Transparency : Everything is open and traceable.
Self-reflection : Sigma reads its own history to learn.
Decentralized ethics : No black box — only auditable light.
Resilience through iteration : Failure is feedback.
