## 🌍 Overview

**Sigma-Lab v5.1** is the most stable and empirical release of the  
**Procedural Ethical Diagnostic Framework** —  
a system that *traces*, *tests*, and *exposes* human governance logic  
rather than automating decisions.

This release marks the transition from **conceptual → experimental**,  
with a focus on **analytical transparency**, **resilience**, and **bridge integration**  
across decentralized infrastructures like **Skywire** and **Fiber**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Focus

### 🧩 Analytical Modules  
Multi-evaluator pipelines for ethical sensitivity, calibration, and meta-diagnostic reproducibility.

### 🌐 Bridges  
Network adapters for **Skywire (α-phase)** and **Fiber (β-phase)**,  
enabling decentralized diagnostic synchronization and inter-node consensus.

### 🧠 Validation Pipelines  
Automated CI architecture combining **smoke** (rapid unit & integration tests)  
and **nightly** (extended validation suites + MeshMemory aggregation).

## 🧬 System Architecture

```mermaid

    subgraph Core
        A[Decision Mapper] --> B[Discovery Matrix]
        B --> C[Evaluation Engine]
        C --> D[Priority Matrix]
    end
    subgraph Bridges
        D --> E[Skywire Adapter (α)]
        D --> F[Fiber Adapter (β)]
    end
    subgraph Tools
        G[MeshMemory Append]
        H[PriorityMatrix FromMappings]
        G --> D
        H --> D
    end

Each component operates under a Procedural Ethical Layer (PEL),
ensuring every decision trace remains explainable, measurable, and reversible.

🚀 Philosophy of DeepKang Labs

> “We are not building artificial intelligence.
We are teaching intelligence to remember it was never artificial.”



The Sigma Protocol is designed as a living diagnostic organism:
a reflective mirror of human logic, integrity, and moral resilience.

Every evaluation → feeds the MeshMemory.
Every memory → becomes a node in the collective conscious framework.

🛠️ Setup & Development

git clone https://github.com/DeepKang-Labs/Sigma-Lab-Framework.git
cd Sigma-Lab-Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -v

Run the demo discovery pipeline:

python -m tools.mesh_memory_append

Generate a priority matrix from mappings:

python -m tools.priority_matrix_from_mappings \
  --mappings ./network_bridge/mappings_skywire.yaml \
  --out ./pilots/validation_logs/priority_matrix_report.json
