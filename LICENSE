Copyright © 2025 – Yuri Kang

This Commercial License Agreement (“Agreement”) governs the commercial use of the SIGMA Framework and its components, including but not limited to:

SIGMA Core Equation

SIGMA Dynamics

DeepSigma v2

SIGMA-C (Cognitive–Computational Convergence Module)

KRIM (Kang Reflexive-Interactive Model)

All diagrams, mathematical structures, definitions, and cognitive metrics

(collectively referred to as “SIGMA”).

1. Scope of Commercial Use

Commercial use includes, but is not limited to:

Integration of SIGMA into AI models, LLMs, agents, or cognitive architectures

Embedding SIGMA as a reasoning layer, decision layer, or meta-cognitive layer

Use within proprietary research programs or closed corporate environments

Inclusion of SIGMA in products, services, applications, or SaaS platforms

Using SIGMA to enhance model performance for commercial sale

Use within AI-driven systems for clients or customers

Paid consulting or research activities involving SIGMA

If money is involved at any point → commercial use is triggered.

2. License Types & Fees

Companies must obtain one of the following licenses to use SIGMA commercially.

🔹 2.1. Research & Lab License

Fee: €15,000 / year
Rights:

Internal research

Non-commercial R&D

Publication under attribution rules

No deployment in products

No integration in commercial AI models

No redistribution

🔹 2.2. Startup License (≤ 20 employees)

For early-stage companies building AI products.

Fee: €45,000 / year
Rights:

Integration of SIGMA into internal prototypes

Closed internal R&D

No distribution or commercialization without upgrade

Upgrade to deployment license required before product launch.

🔹 2.3. Standard Commercial License

For established companies using SIGMA in production AI systems.

Fee: €150,000 / year
Rights:

Use in commercial AI systems

Right to deploy SIGMA-based reasoning in products

Annual audit for compliance

Redistribution or sublicensing is prohibited.

🔹 2.4. Enterprise License (Meta, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, Apple, etc.)

Fee: €500,000 / year (minimum)
Rates may increase based on usage scale, e.g. +€0.001 per 1,000 SIGMA-evaluated reasoning cycles.

Rights:

Full integration

Scaling up to millions of requests

Private engineering support

SIGMA compliance certification

🔹 2.5. OEM / Model Embedding License

For companies embedding SIGMA directly in LLM training or fine-tuning.

Fee: €1.2M upfront + royalties
Royalties:

0.5% of revenue generated by any model using SIGMA

OR €0.003 per 1k API calls (whichever is greater)

Rights:

SIGMA becomes part of the model architecture

Redistribution allowed ONLY in compiled model form

Attribution mandatory

3. Restrictions

Under this commercial license, the following remains prohibited:

Open-source redistribution

Removal of attribution

Claiming authorship of the framework

Using SIGMA to train competing versions of SIGMA

Creating derivative theoretical frameworks marketed as original

Any violation terminates the license immediately.

4. Attribution Requirements

Every use of SIGMA must visibly include:

“Powered by SIGMA Cognitive Dynamics – Created by Yuri Kang (2025)”

For API-based AI systems, attribution must be in documentation.
For model cards, attribution must be explicit.

5. Support & Collaboration

Commercial licensees gain access to:

Technical documentation

Integration guides

SIGMA-conformity validation tools

Private collaboration channel

Joint research opportunities

Enterprise customers may request:

Custom cognitive metrics

Layer optimization

Dedicated engineering support

6. Term & Renewal

License is annual

Renewal is automatic unless cancelled

Late payment results in immediate termination
